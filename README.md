# Tip Splitter in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Useage
I made this project to help split tips at work. It is always a tedius process counting and splitting the money at the end of the night, so why not automate it? If you have a job where you have to split tips, feel free to use this!

## Features
Can add and subtract employees from dropdown list (this will be remembered between sessions)

## Check it out
I have deployed this project to vercel and it can be viewed [here](https://tips-alpha.vercel.app/)
